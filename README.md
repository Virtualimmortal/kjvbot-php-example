<p>This code is for demonstration purposes only, and is intended to express my ability to write PHP code natively.  I was not intending on showcasing this code at the time of development.  This was a personal project of mine that i have set up and use daily on my local network.  There is also a ReactJS version of this application.  Thank you for your interest!
