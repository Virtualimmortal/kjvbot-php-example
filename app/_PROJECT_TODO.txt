Add initial scroll up and down to load more if there is only a verse or two in the view instead of a click to load more.  This way i can use the click event on each verse for selecting the verse, and use scroll up and down for loading more when there is not enough


Add click selecting 
	- Clicking on a verse to add it to a list for aggregation
